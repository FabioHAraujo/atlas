//! Log pane behavior on `App`: incremental find / filter with n/N, problem
//! jumps (`]e`/`[e`), link cursor + open (`o`), view toggles (wrap,
//! timestamps, JSON), horizontal pan, marks, restart separators, new-line
//! count while paused, and per-tab activity / error badges.
//!
//! Everything that looks at the whole buffer goes through `sync_logs`, which
//! advances an incremental `ViewIndex` + `RowCache`: a frame or a keypress
//! costs O(new lines + visible rows), never O(buffer).
